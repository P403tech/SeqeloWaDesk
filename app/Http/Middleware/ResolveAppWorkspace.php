/**
 * Mobile-app workspace/device scoping.
 *
 * A browser session carries the active workspace in users.current_workspace_id,
 * flipped by the header dropdown. The Flutter app has no session — one Bearer
 * token, many workspaces — so it tells us which workspace (and, optionally,
 * which device) a request is about via headers:
 *
 *   X-Workspace-Id: <id>     (fallback: `workspace_id` in the body/query)
 *   X-Device-Id:    <id>     (fallback: `device_id`   in the body/query)
 *
 * When X-Workspace-Id is present we VERIFY the caller is a joined member of that
 * workspace, then set current_workspace_id IN MEMORY for this request only (no
 * save) so every existing `forCurrentWorkspace()` scope + `current_workspace_id`
 * read resolves to the requested workspace. No header → the token's stored
 * current_workspace_id is used, exactly as before (so /workspaces itself, and
 * every legacy call, keep working). A header naming a workspace the user isn't a
 * member of is a hard 403 — never a silent cross-tenant leak.
 *
 * X-Device-Id is validated to belong to the resolved workspace and stashed on
 * the request (`app_device_id`) for endpoints that want an implicit device; it
 * never hard-fails when absent (most device endpoints take the id in the path).
